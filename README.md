## Motivation
When the students who served in Auburn during World War II in 1947 returned to the university, they felt alienated and unfamiliar with everyone. They wanted to really return to campus, so they organized a hey day event on a whim. Stick their names on their chests Before, so that all the people said hello and hoped to know each other and care for each other. This activity has continued to this day and has become a beautiful landscape in Auburn. On this day, everyone gathered together cheerfully wearing name stickers. Say Hi again and know each other again. The warmth of the Auburn family was passed on.
